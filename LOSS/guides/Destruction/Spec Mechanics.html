<p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/348-immolate">Immolate</a> - Applies a debuff to your target that deals damage over 18 seconds, periodic damage tics has a 50% chance to grant you 1 Soul Shard Fragment. Critical strikes has a 100% chance to generate 1 Soul Shard Fragment. Haste will make this spell tick more often.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/17962-conflagrate">Conflagrate</a> - Instant cast that generates 6 Soul Shard Fragments. This generates double resources from hitting a second Havoc Target.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/29722-incinerate">Incinerate</a> - Generates 1 Soul Shard Fragment on a normal hit and 2 Soul Shard Fragments on a critical strike.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/116858-chaos-bolt">Chaos Bolt</a> - Primary Soul Shard spender. Costs 2 Soul Shards, is a relatively long cast but also deals a large amount of damage.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/5740-rain-of-fire">Rain of Fire</a> - Our main AoE spell, costs 3 Soul Shards and deals damage over 8 seconds at a targeted location.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/80240-havoc">Havoc</a> - A 10 second debuff that causes all your single target spells to also strike the affected target. This does not count for Dimensional Rift. Since Havoc is on a 45 second cooldown (25 if specced Wreak Havoc) you can gain a lot of damage by making sure you play your Havoc uptime right. Try your best to be ready for Havoc to come off cooldown, this means have shards and potential damage buffs ready for that 10-second window.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/18540-summon-doomguard">Summon Doomguard</a> or <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/1122-summon-infernal">Summon Infernal</a>? - <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/224103-lord-of-flames?artifactRank=1">Lord of Flames</a> makes your Summon Infernal a very strong cooldown, this should be used whenever your raid requires high damage during a specific part of the fight. This tends to be when Bloodlust is popped aswell. Keep in mind you will most likely only get 1 Lord of Flames proc off per fight as it has a 10 minute cooldown. If you have Lord of Flames on CD you should use Summon Doomguard instead.</p>

<p>Spenders - Should i use Rain of Fire or should i use Chaos Bolts to drop my shards? The short answer is 3+ targets = Rain of Fire. If you have Havoc ready this goes up to 4 targets as you would otherwise be able to Chaos Bolt into your Havoc. This being said, it obviously depends on the situation you're in. Realistically, in a progression raiding scenario you will have priority adds that have to die within a certain amount of this, this means you might be better off focusing that target instead of doing what grants you the most damage overall.</p>
