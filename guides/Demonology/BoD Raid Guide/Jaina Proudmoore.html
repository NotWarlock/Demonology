    <!-- ## Basic Boss overview, talent, and trait explanation ## -->
     This is a multi-phased primarily single target encounter with some priority add burns.  Phase 1 is pretty much entirely single target as adds are either Mind Controlled off the boat or obliterated before you can deal any significant damage to them.  Phase 2 has more targets, namely ice blocks and ordinances that must be burned. 2nd Intermission is 3 separate burst adds (Ice Wall, Nathanos, Tidewater Elemental).  Phase 3 is a single target burn with ranged priority adds (Prismatic Images), and ice blocks.  <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267211/bilescourge-bombers" target="_blank">Bilescourge Bombers</a> gains significant strength in Phase 2 and on as it has similar total damage to <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267171/demonic-strength" target="_blank">Demonic Strength</a> at half the cooldown and is quite handy for breaking ice blocks in melee, otherwise your talents are the usual options with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=264057/soul-strike" target="_blank">Soul Strike</a> for added mobility.  As usual your azerite and trinket choices depend on the gear you have available, be sure to sim your character over at <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.<br>
   
    <!-- ## Insert boss specific tips ## -->
    <ul>
    <li>Tyrant should be used either on the Ice Wall or Elemental in the 2nd intermission, use your brain to determine which is causing more issues.</li>
    <li>Swap to Implosion rotation as people get frozen in melee to clear ice blocks, save Bombers if you have a large break planned in Phase 3.</li>
    <li>Gateway can be quite useful in Phase 1 to clear fire on far ballistas, and in Phase 2 and Phase 3 to reposition around icy patches and get to ordnances and images. </li>
    </ul>

    <!--## Insert Best Legendarie's & why ## -->
    In addition to the drastically increased health and damage of everything in the encounter, the Mythic version of this encounter adds frozen ballistas in phase 1 and has a drastically higher damage requirement for Ice Wall and Jaina in 2nd intermission and in phase 3.  Killing the Tide Elemental in the final phase causes it to split into 2 so the current strategy avoids killing it in favor of interrupting it while bursting the boss down, however this has little effect on boss damage for Demo so you will just tunnel the boss and ignore the Tide Elemental entirely.  Timing on this fight is not favorable for <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=111898/grimoire-felguard" target="_blank">Grimoire Felguard</a> so <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=215941/soul-conduit" target="_blank">Soul Conduit</a> is recommended, especially after 8.1.5 where Felguard will be nerfed.  Incoming damage is extremely high in the latter half of the encounter so <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=219272/demon-skin" target="_blank">Demon Skin</a> is highly recommended and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=288953/treacherous-covenant" target="_blank">Treacherous Covenant</a> is highly not recommended.<br>
    <!--## Insert boss specific tips ## -->
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=288802/bonded-souls" target="_blank">Bonded Souls</a> provides an insane amount of extra healing and some haste to a friend, consider picking up one of these traits if the healers are struggling.  The shared haste makes this trait perform a lot better in reality than it does in sims.</li>
