  <h2><u>Wild Imps</u></h2>
<p>Wild Imps are a core element to Demonology gameplay and have a couple mechanics that are not particularly obvious.  First and foremost, unlike in Legion where imps lasted 12s and free cast their entire duration, in BFA imps have 100 energy and spend 20 energy on each Firebolt and expire at 0 energy.  Firebolt cast is 2s baseline and scales down with haste, so higher haste means imps expire faster (e.g. at 0% haste an imp will last 10s after spawn, at 100% it will last 5s after spawn).  Wild Imps have a 10% chance to generate a Demonic Core on expiry.  Please note that while the damage of each imp is not affected by haste outside Tyrant, haste still increases the total imps you summon in a given fight via extra casts of Shadowbolt, Demonbolt, and Hand of Gul'dan so remains a strong stat.  Imps spawned from Hand of Gul'Dan have spawn delays both from the HoG animation (0.7s) and then additional 0.4s delays for each imp summoned that does not scale with haste.  For example, a 3 shard HoG will spawn imps at 1.1s, 1.5s, and 1.9s after the HoG cast completes.  These spawn delays are especially relevant to Demonic Consumption, Explosive Potential, and Implosion, explained further below.  While out of combat, imps will expire in 20s and not grant demonic cores upon expiry.</p>
  <h2><u>Summon Demonic Tyrant</u></h2>
<p>Demonic Tyrant is Demo's primary cooldown, it deals high single target damage on its own, extends the duration of all active demons by 15s, and causes all your active demons to deal 15% increased damage.  In order to make the most use of this ability you will want to use all of your cooldown-based demons (Dreadstalkers, Vilefiend, Grimoire: Felguard) prior to summoning Tyrant as they gain the most from the extended duration and extra damage.  Wild Imps are a special case; while active, Demonic Tyrant will cause any Wild Imps to cast for free throughout its duration and empower them for the standard 15% damage.  Imps with remaining energy will continue to cast after Tyrant expires.  For example, an imp that casts twice before Tyrant is summoned will freecast Firebolts for 15s during Tyrant then cast 3 Firebolts after Tyrant expires.  With the Baleful Invocation trait Tyrant will also generate 5 sould shards on use which drastically increases the strength of the cooldown.</p>
  <h2><u>Demonic Consumption</u></h2>
<p>
  Optimal use of Demonic Consumption involves some forethought or the use of a WeakAura/Addon to track the power gain from summoning Demonic Tyrant based on how many Wild Imps are currently summoned.  Keep in mind the imp spawn delay described in the Wild Imps section as at higher haste levels you will need to wait or cast an additional ability between a 3 shard HoG and Tyrant in order to consume all the imps.</p><br>
  The power gained from consuming your Wild Imps is based on how much remaining energy they have:<br>
  <div class="center">
  <table class="grid" width=250px>
<tr>
<td><b>Point of energy</b></td><td width=50%><b>% damage gain</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20</td><td>10.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>40</td><td>20.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>60</td><td>30.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>80</td><td>40.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td><td>50.00</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
  With this in mind you should look to cast a minimum of 2 3-shard Hand of Gul'dan's back to back before casting Demonic Tyrant, and an additional HoG with any Demonbolt or Conduit procs.  The cast sequence would look something like this:<br>
    <ol>
    <li>Build to 5  Soul Shards</li>
    <li>Cast  Hand of Gul'dan</li>
    <li>Build to 3  Soul Shards</li>
    <li>Cast  Hand of Gul'dan</li>
    <li>Cast Shadowbolt, Demonic Strength, wait a fraction of a second, or cast a low-shard HoG</li>
    <li>Cast  Summon Demonic Tyrant</li>
    </ol>
</p>

  <h2><u>Implosion</u></h2>
<p>
 Implosion is not described very well in game so the mechanics and basic use will be outlined here.  Implosion deals damage to the primary target roughly equal to the remaining damage of each imp based on current energy, while secondary (cleave) targets will always take damage equal to a 100 imp energy implosion (e.g. if each imp Firebolt deals 100 damage, an immediate 1-imp implosion will deal 500 damage, and an implosion after 1 cast will deal 400 damage).  Implosion can crit and scales with mastery, but is not affected by From the Shadows or the Tyrant empowerment.  On single target, Implosion is only used to maintain Explosive Potential and in order to maintain the buff you will want to implode whenever the buff is close to expiring after the opener. Keep in mind the imp spawn delay described in the Wild Imps section as at higher haste levels you will need to cast additional abilities for 2 globals between a HoG and Implosion in order implode all of the imps from that HoG.  In cleave situations the Implosion rotation varies based on the amount of Demonic Cores you have stocked.</p>  <br>
 We can explore these situations a bit more in details here:<br>
 <br>
 If you have <b>2</b> or more stacks of Demonic Core you...
 <ul>
    <li>Build to 5 Soul Shards</li>
    <li>Cast Hand of Gul'dan</li>
    <li>Build 4 Soul Shards using Demonbolt</li>
    <li>Cast Hand of Gul'dan</li>
    <li>Build to 3 Soul Shards using Demonbolt</li>
    <li>Cast Hand of Gul'dan</li>
    <li>Cast Shadow Bolt</li>
    <li>Cast Shadow Bolt</li>
    <li>Cast Implosion</li>
  </ul>
  If you have <b>1 or 0</b> stacks of Demonic Core you...
  <ul>
    <li>Build to 5 Soul Shards</li>
    <li>Cast Hand of Gul'dan</li>
    <li>Build to 3 Soul Shards</li>
    <li>Cast Hand of Gul'dan</li>
    <li>Cast Shadow Bolt or Demonbolt if you have a stack of Demonic Core</li>
    <li>Cast Shadow Bolt</li>
    <li>Cast Implosion</li>
  </ul>

<h2><u>Refreshing DoTs</u></h2>
<p>
  Just like in past expansions we have the 'Pandemic' effect as baseline for any DoT or buff effects you cast.
</p>
<p>
  You're able to refresh your DoT or buff at 30% duration remaining and not lose time on your DoT or buff. For example: Doom has a base duration of 30s, 30% of that duration is 9s. If you refresh Doom at or under 9s the remaining duration will carry over to the 'new' Doom. There are many addons that can display Pandemic range for your Doom, for BFA I will be using WeakAuras to display that information.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to all this because Doom only deals it's damage once over 30s you can still cast it during the Pandemic window and it will deal it's damage no matter when you refresh the DoT. It does damage once every 30s, period.
</p>

<h2><u>How Doom works</u></h2>
<p>
The following information about Doom is based on hours of work put in during Legion and testing Doom. With the new haste scaling effect tacked onto Doom I feel it is necessary to rehash how refreshing Doom works. This information is compiled with the help of LOSS friend, Ipse.<br>

Doom is a dot, it ticks for damage at the end of it's duration. Doom can partially tick if it's doesn't tick for it's full tickrate. If Doom is going to fall off before reaching it's full tick duration, the tick will happen at the end of Doom's duration unless Doom is refreshed. Then the current tick will take how ever much more time it needs from the refresh to fully tick.<br>
Doom's pandemic window is based on your current haste (it's current tickrate). Shard generation is based on how much Doom ticked, vs it's tickrate. Doom snapshots haste on cast, but the hasted interval is only calculated, from the next tick.<br>

<strong><i>Let's look at some examples:</i></strong><br>

<strong>Short -> Long | (High Haste -> Low Haste)</strong><br>

Let's assume that you cast Doom, with haste such that it's tickrate is 10 seconds. Your haste when you casted the Doom, has now snapshotted it's tickrate (10 seconds). If your haste effects now fall off, such that Doom's tickrate is now 30 seconds (Doom's pandemic is now 9 seconds).<br>
Assume that you now refresh Doom at 4 seconds remaining, bringing it's duration up to 34 seconds. Doom will then tick 4 seconds after the refresh at 30 seconds, for a full tick. The next Doom tick then starts, snapshotting the lest refresh's haste as it's tickrate.<br>

<strong>Long -> Short | (Long Haste -> High Haste)</strong><br>

Let's say that you opened with Doom (before your haste procs and Bloodlust). Applying a Doom with a tickrate of 30 seconds (snapshotting your haste). Now you gain some haste, through the effects of Bloodlust and/or trinkets/racials, and Doom's tickrate is brought down to 10 seconds. While under the haste effects, you refresh Doom at 5 seconds. Bringing the duration down to 13 seconds (10 + 10*0.3), because it's current pandemic is 3 seconds.<br>
You've now brought the duration of a Doom, with the tickrate of 30 seconds, down to 13 seconds. You will get a tick at the end of Dooms duration, that will deal 43% damage (13/30) and have a 43% change to generate a shard.<br>

<strong>Extended ticklength</strong><br>

Let's assume a situation in which you refresh a short Doom, with a long duration above it's pandemic threshold. For simplicity we'll keep the ticks at 20 and 30 respectively.<br> 
You cast Doom to start the fight. Then refresh it with another cast of Doom when it has 29 seconds remaining (1 seconds after you applied it).<br>
This brings the duration up to 39 seconds (30 + 0.3*30). <br>
Doom will tick at 27 seconds remaining (12 seconds after the refresh), snapshotting the next hasted interval with the last refreshed tickrate (30 seconds).
Following the logic provided, Doom should partially tick at the end of it's duration for 90% damage, and an 90% chance to generate a shard.<br>
Now assume that you refresh Doom before it expires at 3 seconds remaining, pushing Doom's duration to 33 seconds (30 + 3).<br>
Doom now has enough time to make a full tick, so the next tick will get pushed back from the time at which it would have expired to 9 seconds after the refresh (20 seconds remaning).<br>
</p>

  <h2><u>Choosing the right pet</u></h2>
<p>
  There isn't much for choice anymore since they are pushing each spec towards a particular direction when it comes to using a certain pet. For Demonology you are pushed towards using Felguard as your all-purpose pet.
