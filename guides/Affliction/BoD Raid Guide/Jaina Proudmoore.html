    <!-- ## Basic Boss overview, talent, and trait explanation ## -->
     This is a multi-phased primarily single target encounter with some priority add burns.  Phase 1 is pretty much entirely single target as adds are either Mind Controlled off the boat or obliterated before you can deal any significant damage to them.  Phase 2 has more targets, namely ice blocks and ordinances that must be burned. Phase 3 is 3 separate burst adds (Ice Wall, Nathanos, Tidewater Elemental).  Phase 4 is a single target burn with ranged priority adds (Prismatic Images), and ice blocks. Since most adds will not live long enough for Agony to ramp, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=35195/siphon-life" target="_blank">Siphon Life</a> is the go-to talent.  <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=273521/inevitable-demise" target="_blank">Inevitable Demise</a> is useful for quickly bursting ordinances, ice wall, tide elemental, and prismatic images, otherwse normal single-target traits take priority.  As usual your azerite and trinket choices depend on the gear you have available, be sure to sim your character over at <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.<br>

    <li>Unexploded Ordnance barrels can be used to generate shards and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=273521/inevitable-demise" target="_blank">ID</a> stacks with Agony, make sure to watch damage on them and stop dots if needed as early breaks can cause wipes.</li>
    <li>Imp can dispel the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=287626/grasp-of-frost" target="_blank">Grasp of Frost</a> and is also the best pet for swapping targets.</li>
    <li>Gateway can be quite useful in p1 to clear fire on far ballistas and in p2 and p3 to reposition around icy patches and get to ordnances and images. </li>

    <!--## Insert Best Legendarie's & why ## -->
    In addition to the drastically increased health and damage of everything in the encounter, the Mythic version of this encounter adds frozen ballistas in phase 1 and has a drastically higher damage requirement for Ice Wall and Jaina in 2nd intermission and in phase 3.  Killing the Tide Elemental in the final phase causes it to split into 2 so the current strategy avoids killing it in favor of interrupting it while bursting the boss down, and allowing you to use it as an additional target for Agony shards and Inevitable Demise stacks.  <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=35195/siphon-life" target="_blank">Siphon Life</a> is the standard talent for the fight, although <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=196102/writhe-in-agony" target="_blank">Writhe in Agony</a> can be close or better with multiple <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278721/sudden-onset" target="_blank">Sudden Onset</a> traits assuming you have no better trait options.  Incoming damage is extremely high in the latter half of the encounter so <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=219272/demon-skin" target="_blank">Demon Skin</a> is highly recommended and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=288953/treacherous-covenant" target="_blank">Treacherous Covenant</a> is highly not recommended.<br>

    <ul>
    <li>There are a number of extra adds throughout the fight to generate shards and ID stacks off of, froze ballistas in phase 1, ordnance barrels in phase 2, and the Tide Elemental in phase 3, as a result <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=273521/inevitable-demise" target="_blank">Inevitable Demise</a> is extremely strong in all phases due for both burst potential and survival, 1 of these traits is essentially mandatory.  Be sure to save a 50-stack drain for the 2nd intermission to use either on the Ice Wall or Jaina depending on guild needs.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=288802/bonded-souls" target="_blank">Bonded Souls</a> provides an insane amount of extra healing and some haste to a friend, consider picking up one of these traits if the healers are struggling.  However, Inevitable Demise remains both a stronger damage and survival tool so do not take Bonded over ID.</li>
    <li>Imp can dispel the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=287626/grasp-of-frost" target="_blank">Grasp of Frost</a> and is also the best pet for swapping targets, however the Felhunter can interrupt Jaina as soon as Nathanos is broken in the 2nd intermission if you do not have a Hunter.  The optimal pet play here is starting with Imp for dispels in phase 1 and 2 and swapping to Felhunter in phase 2 prior to the 2nd intermission.</li>
    <li>You will get 3 total Darkglare's on this fight and 4 total Dark Souls.  In phase 1 you'll use both on pull and 2nd Dark Soul on cooldown afterwards.  You'll have both near the start of phase 2, and both at the start of phase 3 with 2nd pot.  </li>
    <li>Demonic Circle can be used to return to group after mechanics like Avalance and Siegebreaker Blast to alleviate potential freezes.</li>
    <li>Gateway is typically placed across thr room from the Ice Wall towards where Jaina is standing at the start of 2nd intermission to allow the raid to quickly get back to damaging her.  Most guilds will need to hold dps during phase 2 so placing it after the 2nd Blizzard is usually ideal.</li>
