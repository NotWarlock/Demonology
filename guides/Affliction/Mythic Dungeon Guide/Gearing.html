    <h2>Stats</h2>
    </div>

    <p>There are a few things to consider depending on what build you end up using.<br>
    For the <b>Sow the Seeds</b> build you want as little mastery as possible as Seed of Corruption does not scale very well at all with Mastery.<br>
    For the other build using either <b>Soul Harvest</b> or <b>Phantom Singularity</b> you will want a fairly heavy Haste set for faster GCDs to allow you to get all your DoT effects rolling as fast as possible.<br>
    <br>
    In the grand scheme of things all stats have value but you will want to have <b>as much Haste as humanly possible</b>.

    <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a>
    <p>Sephuz is the best single legendary in the game for M+ by a large margin and we will get into specific uses for it in the <a href="/#/Affliction/Mythic Dungeon Guide/Dungeon Tips" target="_blank">Dungeon Tips</a> section of the guide. This legendary in particular has incredible power assuming you can proc it, especially on short pulls or bosses. The best way to proc it is by using your Infernal's stun or purge, Doomguard's interrupt, Howl of Terror, Fear, Banish and Arcane Torrent (if Blood Elf).<br>
    Keep the ring's proc effect on cooldown as much as possible without screwing up any CC order of the group.<br>
    Even if you're not able to proc the effect of the ring it has very strong stats for Affliction and should not be dismissed due to the lack of a direct damage bonus when you can't proc it. The passive 2% multiplicative haste on top of the natural stats of the ring are great!

    <h4>Good legendaries for trash</h4>
    The following legendaries are to be always used in combination with <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> for trash:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/151821-the-master-harvester" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">The Master Harvester</span></a>: Good option to use in combination with T20 4P and useful in any situation with high shard turnover, especially when playing with Sow the Seeds.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132394-hood-of-eternal-disdain" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Hood of Eternal Disain</span></a>: Best alternative next to <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/151821-the-master-harvester" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">The Master Harvester</span></a>. Less useful legendary while playing with Sow the Seeds.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132381-stretens-sleepless-shackles" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Streten's Sleepless Shackles</span></a>: Useful for trash pulls where you only pull 2-4 targets when not using Sow the Seeds. Multidot Unstable Affliction as much as possible to keep the buff stacks up.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132378-sacrolashs-dark-strike" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sacrolashs Dark Strike</span></a>: Very strong for packs you need to kite. For example Pelters in Neltharion's Lair and spiders in Cathedral of Eternal Night, among others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Good legendaries for bosses</h4>
    Typically your best combination of legendaries would use for raid for single target encounters will be best with the exception being when you can proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> and don't need the survival benefit of <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132444-prydaz-xavarics-magnum-opus" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Prydaz, Xavaric's Magnum Opus</span></a> on bosses such as Hyrja or Xakal as some examples on higher keys. Some other good legendaries to use in specific:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132394-hood-of-eternal-disdain" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Hood of Eternal Disain</span></a>: Best overall legendary to use with T21.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132457-power-cord-of-lethtendris" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Power cord of Lethtendris</span></a>: Best single target legendary with T20 and also very strong when used with T21.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/151649-soul-of-the-netherlord" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Soul of the Netherlord</span></a>: Good if you're on the last boss of Eye of Azshara and don't already have Death's Embrace talented.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Trinkets</h2>
    </div>

    <p>In general you are looking to bolster your static stats as much as possible throughout any dungeon. Some trinkets (or types of trinkets) you should be looking for are:
    <ul>
    <li>Stat sticks</li>
    <li>Stat proc trinkets</li>
    <li>Arcanocrystal</li>
    <li>Prototype Personnel Decimator (from Garothi Worldbreaker) - <i>Be careful when using this as it can and will randomly pull additional and possibly unwanted trash mobs</i></li>
    <li>Terminus Signaling Beacon (from High Command) - <i>This trinket is great for larger or shorter packs as well!</i>
    </ul>
