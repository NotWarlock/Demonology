    <p>From an overall viewpoint your best choice from this tier will be Writhe in Agony but Malefic Grasp can be used in some situations.<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Writhe in Agony has the opportunity for better burst than Malefic Grasp on adds that may spawn or damage buffs (Odyn's runes for example).</li>
    <li>Writhe in Agony is more flexible on all key types even on Tyrannical.</li>
    <li>Malefic Grasp is a possible choice to use if running Court of Stars or Upper Kara but Writhe in Agony is just as good if not better for the majority of the instance.</li>
    <li>Malefic Grasp is usable if doing low level keys, heroics and Mythic 0 as you are blasting through them where Agony doesn't have the ability to ramp.</li>
    </ul>
    Haunt is never an option you should entertain - unless you need spark damage on Curator and will be summoned right after.

    <p>This tier is a bit more cut and dry in terms of talent usage as you will see here:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Play Contagion if you are playing Phantom Singularity or Soul Harvest.</li>
    <li>Play Empowered Life Tap if you are playing Sow the Seeds.</li>
    <li>Absolute Corruption is best used in Seat of the Triumvirate.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>For this set of talents you are again basically choosing between two talents as one of them is not a very viable option, explained below:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Howl of Terror is the more widely used talent because of it's synergy with the proc effect of <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> as well as giving you the ability to interrupt a large group of mobs without messing up your group's stun chains and is a fairly safe option for CC as it breaks immediately on damage.</li>
    <li>Demonic Circle also is used fairly often depending on the dungeon and most especially during weeks with Tyrannical on a few specific dungeons: Upper Kara for Medivh's Inferno Bolt, Arcway for Nartila's web and Darkheart Thicket for Xavius' Nightmare Bolt.</li>
    <li>Mortal Coil while it does have synergy with <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> is not a good option as it fears the mob in random directions and out of the group's normal AoE.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>A good rule of thumb for this tier of talents is: Sow the Seeds means <i>I want to do a lot of damage to all the targets all the time</i>, Soul Harvest means <i>I want to do a lot of damage to this target among these targets</i> and Phantom Singularity is somewhere between the two. As this may be the most interchangeable tier of talents we'll go more into detail about them...<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Sow the Seeds is a very good option to take if the dungeon has unavoidable large packs and/or your group wants to pull large packs. Some examples of this would be Arcway, Lower Kara and Black Rook Hold. However you should always take into consideration the affixes for the week since some dungeons also have unavoidable packs where Sow the Seeds may not be the best option (Bolstering or Bursting for example) on spider pulls in Vault of the Wardens.</li>
    <li>Soul Harvest is a good option for dungeons like Eye of Azshara and Neltharion's Lair since you can gain a lot of extended Soul Harvest time on boss fights as there are larger trash pulls immediately before a boss or during the boss encounter that you can leech extra time from or provide you with the extra spread damage you might need.</li>
    <li>Phantom Singularity is always a solid choice as it is a good middle ground between the other two talents if you aren't sure whether or not you will need AoE or Single Target. If you're ever unsure of what talent to take in this tier, take Phantom Singularity.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
    <ul>
    <li> Burning Rush is your general go-to for this tier as it provides you with the desired movement required for a very little in return.<br>
    <li> Dark Pact is a very good defensive cooldown especially for bosses that cast very large and very predictable hits. Some examples of this would be Lady Hatecoil in Eye of Azshara, Hyrja in Halls of Valor, or Xavius in Dark Heart Thicket. <i>If you dismiss your pet prior to using Dark Pact it makes the shield based on your own health pool resulting in very very big shields</i><br>
    <li> Demonskin has very limited use if you are taking a more defensive option in this tier as the damage reduction is not an immediate surge of required healing/etc. There are some very small cases where Demonskin can be used where it is possible for you to die to trickling damage or where you could potentially die to overkill which can occur more frequently than Dark Pact's cooldown.
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>There is only one option in this tier: <b>Grimoire of Supremacy</b>.</p>

    <div class="center">
    <img class="heading" src="http://i.imgur.com/jhD3KSul.png">
    </div>

    <p>For the majority of instances your choice will boil down between Death's Embrace or Soul Conduit and can depend on what other gear or talents you are using and in some cases what affixes/role you are playing for the dungeon. For example:<br>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Soul Conduit</b> is generally going to be your go-to talent choice in this tier, especially if you are using the T20 4pc.</li>
    <li><b>Death's Embrace</b> is a also a good option to take, specifically with the dot build. However, you should try to avoid using it in dungeons like Halls of Valor (Hymdall and Odyn) and Maw of Souls (Helya) where bosses don't drop far enough into execute.</li></ul>
    For the most part Siphon Life is unused outside of very high level keys of Upper Kara with Tyrannical where you might need the damage on Medivh and Mana Worm and plan on getting a summon back into the instance after killing Curator. The same idea of being summoned back to the instance is also applicable in Court of Stars after you kill Talixae.
