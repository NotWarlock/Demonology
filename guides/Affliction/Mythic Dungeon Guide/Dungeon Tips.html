    <h2>General info for all dungeons</h2>
    </div>

    <p>The number one thing you can do for your group is make sure they all have Healthstones all the time. The Soulwell is on a relatively short CD and heals for a truckload and then some. Whenever you have an opportunity put down a new Soulwell for everyone in the group to refresh their supply.<br>
    Use Potion of Prolonged Power as much as possible assuming it won't break your bank. For nearly every instance you can have 100% uptime of the potion. There are a few dungeons where Invis Potions, Skystep Potions, or Avalanche Elixir are very useful and can shave time off the run which will be outlined in a bit more detail per dungeon. All potions share a cooldown with each other.<br>
    You should also keep in mind that summon stones <i>do</i> work in Mythic+ so if someone leaves the dungeon you can get them back to your group; however, it does take two summons: one to get them into the instance (at the front) and another to get them to the group. Generally this is not worth the time investment if you are trying to hit a specific timer but can be useful if you need to change talents if you're already going to miss the timer.

    <h2>How to handle Affixes</h2>
    </div>

    <h3>Bolsering</h3>
    <p>Banished mobs do not bolster so if you can take advantage of Banishing a high HP target to avoid them gaining even more HP from the bolstering effect it is very good! Enslave works the same way if you need to "immune" a second target. </p>

    <h3>Explosive</h3>
    <p>Spec Death's Embrace instead of Soul Conduit if you are the primary DPS on orbs.</p>

    <h3>Grievous</h3>
    <p>Dark Pact is a strong option depending on the dungeon to assist with mitigating some of the damage, or to avoid dropping low enough to get the debuff in the first place.</p>

    <h3>Bursting</h3>
    <p>Dark Pact is a good option to have depending on how big the packs are in the dungeon or if you are pulling multiple packs together.</p>

    <h3>Quaking</h3>
    <p>The best way to avoid getting locked out of Shadow (AKA your whole toolkit) is to utilize the Quaking time to refresh DoTs or cast Life Tap to avoid as much downtime as possible. UR can also be used to avoid the silence if you feel the need to cast more and will not need UR before it comes off cooldown. An example of this is if you need to heal yourself on Medihv during Flame Wreath.</p>

    <h3>Sanguine</h3>
    <p>Make sure you aren't using <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132378-sacrolashs-dark-strike" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sacrolashs Dark Strike</span></a> unless you have some sort of solution to get mobs out of the healing pools (Typhoon, Grip, etc) if it is necessary on certain packs. If your group has or may have troubles with mobs getting stuck in Sanguine a possible solution is to use Mortal Coil.</p>

    <h2>Dungeon Specific Tips</h2>
    </div>

    <h3>Arcway</h3>

    <p>Enslaving an Eredar Chaosbringer (on the demon side of the dungeon, going left in the dungeon from the start) can be very useful but be sure to turn off the auto-casting feature on Brand of the Legion for more control over the power of the buff. The following macros are very useful:
    <ul>
    /cast [@player] Brand of the Legion<br>
    /cast [@mouseover,exists,help][] Brand of the Legion<br>
    </ul>
    One casts on you the other your mouseover if available and your target if not.<br>
    Be sure to dismiss this enslaved mob before the last boss or it can bug the encounter.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Banish can be extremely useful on a number of the demon packs on the left side of the dungeon as well. Be sure to use it accordingly and as needed.<br>
    By paying close attention to the timers on Xakal you are able to pre-cast Dark Pact with 17-18s before Wicked Slam and you will have Dark Pact for the 1st and 2nd slams allowing you to have Unending Resolve available to you for the 3rd slam and then rinse-repeat the Dark Pact cycle for the 4th and 5th casts of Wicked Slam.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Here are some additional uses of yours and your pets' abilities that can proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> or just be useful in general:
    <ul>
    <li>Infernal can purge Brand of the Legion from Chaos Bringers and Unstable Flux from Withered Fiend.</li>
    <li>Doomguard can interrupt on Ivanyr.</li>
    <li>Infernal can stun and you can fear and banish the bats on Xakal.</li>
    <li>Infernal can stun and you can fear the spiders on Nal'tira.</li>
    <li>Infernal can purge and Doomguard can interrupt on Advisor depending on group needs.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Darkheart Thicket</h3>

    <p>You can enslave the Tainted Summoner (one of the mobs right before Xavius) for a mega huge Dark Pact shield if required.
    </p>
    <p>This is how you can proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> on bosses:
    <ul>
    <li>Archdruid: Stun, Fear or Banish the abominations.</li>
    <li>Oakheart: Stun or Fear the saplings. You can also fear the roots. </li>
    <li>Dresaron: Stun or Fear the mini drakes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Neltharion's Lair</h3>
    <p>In the water next to Rokmora there are fish that can easily be solo'd while you wait for him to activate to get some extra souls and Wrath of Consumption stacks for the boss.<br>
    You can extend the length of Soul Harvest on every boss in this dungeon via add spawns.<br>
    Pelter packs can be kited to avoid the damage from Jagged Disc (which has a high chance to instakill anyone in the group in high keys and especially on weeks with Fortified, Raging or Bolstering). <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132378-sacrolashs-dark-strike" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sacrolashs Dark Strike</span></a> makes this a lot easier and Absolute Corruption is not required.<br>
    Dooomguard's Cripple can also be very useful on the final boss if you are kiting the Molten Giant to kill the boss and <i>accidentally</i> put on Agony which broke the Hunter's trap ;).
    </p>
    <p>Some specific ways to proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> on bosses during this instance are:
    <ul>
    <li>Rokmara: Stun or Fear the Skitters.</li>
    <li>Dargrul: Stun the Molten Giant.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Eye of Azshara</h3>
    <p>Most (all) of the tips for this instance are related to the final boss: Make sure you are specced Death's Embrace either naturally or through the use of Soul of the Netherlord and you are able to solo the Crushing Depths that you would normally have to group soak even on fairly high keys by dismissing your pet, using Dark Pact adding Unending Resolve if absolutely necessary.</p>
    <p>To proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> in this instance consider the following:
    <ul>
    <li>Warlord: Interrupt the caster adds.</li>
    <li>Lady Hatecoil: Stun or Fear the blobs that spawn.</li>
    <li>Serpentrix: Interrupt the heads that spawn.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Cathedral of Eternal Night</h3>
    <p>There is nothing really of note for this instance aside from some tips on how to proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> on bosses:
    <ul>
    <li>Agronox: Stun the Lashers.</li>
    <li>Thrashbite: Interrupt the books.</li>
    <li>Domatrax: Interrupt the Imps and/or Banish Imps/Shivarra.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Blackrook Hold</h3>
    <p>You can grab the spirit that flies around near the first boss for Wrath of Consumption, Souls, <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> and Shards. Otherwise consider the following tips for proccing <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a>:
    <ul>
    <li>Amalgam: Stun the Banshees with Infernal or Fear/Stun the spirit that is moving around near the boss room.</li>
    <li>Illysanna: Interrupt or stun the adds which spawn.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Vault of the Wardens</h3>
    <p>The biggest tip for this dungeon is during the second boss, Inquisitor, where you can either use Corruption (safest bet) or Life Tap to clear Soul Sap mechanic.<br>
    Additionally consider proccing <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> in this manner:
    <ul>
    <li>Tirathon: Interrupt the boss or adds which spawn.</li>
    <li>Inquisitor: Interrupt, stun or fear the adds during various phases. If your group can handle pulling an extra dog during the encounter you can chain proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> by Banishing the dog during non-add phases as well.</li>
    <li>Ash'golm: Interrupt the Elementals.</li>
    <li>Cordana: Stun the Vengeance spawn.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Seat of the Trimvirate</h3>
    <p>By using <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132378-sacrolashs-dark-strike" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sacrolashs Dark Strike</span></a> you are able to slow down all the blobs making the first boss fight much easier. The use of this legendary is also helpful with damaging the tentacles during the third boss encounter if that is something your group needs help with.</p>
    <p>There is also a variety of ways you can proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> during this instance:
    <ul>
    <li>Zuraal: Stun or Fear the blobs which spawn.</li>
    <li>Saprish: Interrupt the bird cast.</li>
    <li>Viceroy: Interrupt any cast throughout the fight, either on boss or tentacles. It is worth noting that the tentacles spawn every 30 seconds which lines up perfectly with <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret.</span></a></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Court of Stars</h3>
    <p>The biggest takeaway is that on trash when fighting Risen Arcanists you can purge Fortification using your Infernal. Alternate ways to proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> on boss encounters as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>Patrol Captain: Interrupt the adds which spawn from the beacon(s).</li>
    <li>Talixae: Fear the Imps or interrupt either boss or imps which spawn.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Halls of Valor</h3>
    <p>Again there is little major tips for this instance aside from the fact that you are able to purge Protective Light from Stormforged Sentinals during trash. Otherwise consider proccing <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> on bosses in the following fashion:
    <ul>
    <li>Fenryr P2: Stun or Fear the wolves that spawn.</li>
    <li>God-King: Stun the elementals.</li>
    <li>Odyn: Interrupt the add.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Lower Karazhan</h3>
    <p>Major focus for this instance is proccing <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> appropriately and when possible during boss encounters:
    <ul>
    <li>Wikket: Stun the monkeys or interrupt during Elfyra and Galindre.</li>
    <li>Westfall Story: Interrupt the murlocs.</li>
    <li>Beautiful Beasts: Interrupt in general or stun the forks.</li>
    <li>Maiden: Interrupt casts.</li>
    <li>Moroes: Interrupt adds as needed.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Upper Karazhan</h3>
    <p>Little to write home about aside from proccing <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> on bosses:
    <ul>
    <li>Shade of Medivh: Interrupt Frost casts or the birds' Arcane Bolt.</li>
    <li>Viz'aduum: Interrupt casts or Stun/Fear mobs on the third platform.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Maw of Souls</h3>
    <p>Last and certainly not least everyones favourite fast instance does not offer much in terms of tips however you can proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> on trash through stuns from your Infernal and otherwise in these cases during boss encounters:
    <ul>
    <li>Harabaron: Interrupt the Servitor or stun the fragments.</li>
    <li>Helya: Interrupt casts.</li>
    <li>Your infernal can dispel the Seacursed Swiftblade's dodge buff. However, there is a chance that the dispel will be dodged.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
