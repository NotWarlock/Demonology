  <u><h3>Intellect</h3></u>
    Raw increase to all damage dealt.
</p>
<p>
  <u><h3>Haste</h3></u>
    Makes all of the things faster. More casts/melees/ticks = More dps.
</p>
<p>
  <u><h3>Mastery</h3></u>
  A large increase to the damage of all of your DoTs, as well as Seed of Corruption.
</p>
<p>
  <u><h3>Critical Strike</h3></u>
  Increases the chance for your spells to deal a critical strike for 200% damage.
</p>
<p>
  <u><h3>Versatility</h3></u>
  A relatively weak multiplier to all of your damage, as well as damage taken reduction.
</p>

<h2>General Priority:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Mastery = Haste</li>
    <li>Critical Strike</li>
    <li>Versatility</li>
    <li>Intellect</li>
</ul>
<p>Haste pulls notably ahead of Mastery for ST, but Mastery pulls ahead of Haste for cleave/AoE. There are also some Azerite traits, namely Wracking Brilliance and Inevitable Demise that can favor haste.  For a general set you want a healthy balance of the two.
