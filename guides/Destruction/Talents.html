<p>
    <strong>Tier 1</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267115/flashover" target="_blank">Flashover</a> Conflagrate deals 25% increased damage and grants an additional charge of Backdraft. This talent also makes you able to hold on to 4 stacks of Backdraft.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=196412/eradication" target="_blank">Eradication</a> Chaos Bolt increases the damage you deal to the target by 10% for 7 sec. This debuff is applied once your Chaos Bolt reaches its target.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=6353/soul-fire" target="_blank">Soul Fire</a> Burns the enemy's soul, dealing (100% of Spell power) Fire damage. Soul Fire's Cooldown is reduced by 2 sec for every Soul Shard you spend.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> Currently the strongest option single target in this talent tier is Eradication as it scales better with gear. On 2+ you should take Flashover
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Tier 2</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205148/reverse-entropy" target="_blank">Reverse Entropy</a> Your spells have a chance to grant you 15% Haste for 8 sec.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=266134/internal-combustion" target="_blank">Internal Combustion</a> Chaos Bolt consumes up to 5 sec of Immolate's damage over time effect on your target, instantly dealing that much damage.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=17877/shadowburn" target="_blank">Shadowburn</a> Blasts a target for (60% of Spell power) Shadowflame damage. If the target dies within 5 sec and yields experience or honor, Shadowburn's cooldown is reset.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> All of these options are interesting in their own way. Internal Combusion is the strongers talent in this tier for single target.  Generally on 3+ targets you will play Reverse Entropy. Shadowburn has some utility in its mobility.

<p>
    <strong>Tier 3</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=219272/demon-skin" target="_blank">Demon Skin</a> Your Soul Leech absorption now passively recharges at a rate of 0.5% of maximum health every 1 sec, and may now absorb up to 15% of maximum health.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=111400/burning-rush" target="_blank">Burning Rush</a> Increases your movement speed by 50%, but also damages you for 4% of your maximum health every 1 sec. Movement impairing effects may not reduce you below 100% of normal movement speed.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108416/dark-pact" target="_blank">Dark Pact</a> Sacrifices 20% of your current health to shield you for 250% of the sacrificed health for 20 sec. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> Dark Pact can situationally be very useful but you'll end up choosing Burning Rush most of the time since it's the only real mobility we have as a warlock.  Demon Skin can be used for low mobility fights where there is a constant damage intake.

<p>
    <strong>Tier 4</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=270545/inferno" target="_blank">Inferno</a> Rain of Fire damage has a 20% chance to generate a Soul Shard Fragment.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=196408/fire-and-brimstone" target="_blank">Fire and Brimstone</a> Incinerate now also hits all enemies near your target for 40% damage and generates 1 Soul Shard Fragment for each additional enemy hit.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=152108/cataclysm" target="_blank">Cataclysm</a> Calls forth a cataclysm at the target location, dealing (180% of Spell power) Shadowflame damage to all enemies within 8 yards and afflicting them with Immolate.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> Cataclysm is usually the best. Fire and Brimstone has some use on fights with low priority stacked adds, as it gives you lots of shards.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Tier 5</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=264874/darkfury" target="_blank">Darkfury</a> Reduces the cooldown of Shadowfury by 15 sec.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=6789/mortal-coil" target="_blank">Mortal Coil</a> Mortal Coil has some additional utility due the heal actually applying even if the target is immune to the Mortal Coil effect.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=268358/demonic-circle" target="_blank">Demonic Circle</a> When you select this talent you will gain 2 spells. The first spell is a short cast that places a circle at your location for 15 minutes and the second spell teleports your character to that location.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> In raids you will always choose Demonic Circle. Often you can make some smart plays with this and possibly dodge a mechanic or reduce your downtime. In dungeons you can use Mortal Coil for the heal or if needed Darkfury for the reduced cooldown on Shadowfury.

<p>
    <strong>Tier 6</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205184/roaring-blaze" target="_blank">Roaring Blaze</a> Conflagrate burns the target for an additional (48% of Spell power) Fire damage over 6 sec.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=266086/grimoire-of-supremacy" target="_blank">Grimoire of Supremacy</a> While you have an Infernal active, every Soul Shard you spend increases the damage of your Chaos Bolt by 8%.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108503/grimoire-of-sacrifice" target="_blank">Grimoire of Sacrifice</a> Sacrifices your demon pet for power, gaining its command demon ability, and causing your spells to sometimes also deal (35% of Spell power) additional Shadow damage.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> GoSup is immensely powerful if you need ST burst every 3 minutes, but it lacks on fights with adds and M+ in general. Roaring Blaze gives you strong consistent damage, and will usually be better on fights with adds. In M+, it comes down to where you use Infernal; RB if you Infernal trash, GoSup if you Infernal bosses.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Tier 7</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=215941/soul-conduit" target="_blank">Soul Conduit</a> Every Soul Shard you spend has a 15% chance to be refunded.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=196447/channel-demonfire" target="_blank">Channel Demonfire</a> Launches 15 bolts of felfire over 3 sec at random targets afflicted by your Immolate within 40 yds. Each bolt deals (16% of Spell power) Fire damage to the target and (7% of Spell power) Fire damage to nearby enemies.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=113858/dark-soul-instability" target="_blank">Dark Soul: Instability</a> Infuses your soul with unstable power, increasing your critical strike chance by 30% for 20 sec.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> Dark Soul and CDF are very close overall. Generally speaking, Dark Soul for boss damage, CDF for add/trash damage. You'll usually want CDF in M+ as it works very well with Cataclysm for trash dps.  More discussion about this down below at the builds section. Soul Conduit is overall just kind of weak.
</p>


<h2>Suggested Talent Builds</h2>
 <p><strong>Single Target:</strong></p>

 <x-talent talent="2203023" spec="BFADestruction"></x-talent>

 <p>Although Eradication and Internal Combustion are better in theory they require a bit more maintenance and most people opt to use Flashover and Reverse Entropy as they are close enough together.</p>

 <p><strong>Two Target:</strong></p>

 <x-talent talent="2203023" spec="BFADestruction"></x-talent>

 <p>Although Eradication and Internal Combustion are better in theory they require a bit more maintenance and most people opt to use Flashover and Reverse Entropy as they are close enough together.</p>

 <p><strong>Dungeons:</strong></p>

 <x-talent talent="1123112" spec="BFADestruction"></x-talent>

 <p>This talent build offers you a lot of both consistent and burst damage on both single and multiple targets. If you know your dungeon group and all the pulls throughout the dungeon, DSI will offer very potent burst combined with Grimoire of Supremacy.  If you don't know your group or it's less cooperative, CDF will offer more sustain aoe damage.  Roaring Blaze will probably be better for you if you use Infernal on trash instead of bosses. The reduced cooldown on Shadowfury is nice but can be swapped out depending on what you need.  Shadowburn also has its uses during Explosive Orbs weeks as it will one shot orbs up to around 15/16 keys and give you resets on every kill making you an excellent orb killer.</p>
