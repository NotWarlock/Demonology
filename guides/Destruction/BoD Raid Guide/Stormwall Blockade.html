    <!-- ## Basic Boss overview, talent, and trait explanation ## -->
     This is a multi-phased encounter with a mix of single target and spread cleave.  Phase 1 is largely a single target burn of the two phase one bosses while ocasionally dealing with a Siren while Brother Joseph is on your boat.  Phase 2 is a spread cleave phase with adds spawning at range that must be slowed and bursted down. All of your standard cleave-centric azerite traits are strong, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275425/flashpoint" target="_blank">Flaspoint</a> will be very strong here as well due to having high uptime of the buff due to add spawns.  As usual your azerite and trinket choices depend on the gear you have available, be sure to sim your character over at <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.<br>
   
    <!-- ## Insert boss specific tips ## -->
    <ul>
    <li>Maintain Immolate on all targets and focus the sirens and storm elementals as needed until you or the raid leader decide to burn the boss, Immolate should always be maintained on adds even in the burn phase.</li>
    <li>Make sure to refresh Immolate on the boss before add spawns to minimize dot downtime. </li>
    <li>You should use imp for this encounter to help with swapping between adds and boss. If you're in desperate need of a slow for the storm elementals the succubus has a 30% slow.</li>
    <li>Burning Rush can be useful for clearing more Freezing Tidepools when afflicted with <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=285350/storms-wail" target="_blank">Storm's Wail</a>.</li>
    <li>Circle can be used to get back to the ship in phase 1 if you fail to damage the siren before being thrown off.</li>
    <li>Gateway can be placed either to move across the platform to dodge Sea Swells and soak Ire's of the Deep. </li>
    </ul>

    <!--## Insert Best Legendarie's & why ## -->
    The major difference in the mythic version of this encounter is that the phase 1 mechanics continue into phase 2, namely the siren spawns.  This turns a primarily single-target burn into a heavily multi-target phase so <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275425/flashpoint" target="_blank">Flashpoint</a> gains even more value from this.  This also makes <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278747/rolling-havoc">Rolling Havoc</a> gain more value as you will always have a target to havoc throughout the fight.
