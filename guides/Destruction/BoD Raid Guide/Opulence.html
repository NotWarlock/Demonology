    <!-- ## Basic Boss overview, talent, and trait explanation ## -->
   This is a primarily single target encounter and single target traits and talents are preferred. The gem of choice for this boss is Opal (left side, blue) unless you are assigned to Topaz or Ruby, although shorter kills may favor Emerald. As usual your azerite and trinket choices depend on the gear you have available, be sure to sim your character over at <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.<br>
   
    <!-- ## Insert boss specific tips ## -->
    <ul>
    <li>You should hold Infernal in phase 3 until the second add wave to maximize Opal benefit.</li>
    <li>Save Cataclysm for when adds are about to spawn to instantly tag every mob for Opal stacks, 2% per mob means each wave gives 16% added damage, after 2nd wave you will be at 36% bonus damage (p1 boss + opulence + 2x8 adds) and the cap is 40%.</li>
    <li>It is worth it to cast a few <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=5740/rain-of-fire" target="_blank">Rain of Fires</a> on the adds when they initially spawn.</li>
    <li>Imp will have down time every time the phase 1 bosses move to a new room, Felhunter or Succubus are superior pet choices for damage.</li>

    <!--## Insert Best Legendarie's & why ## -->
    In mythic you will get randomly swapped between rooms during phase 1, and after getting swapped you are immune to damage for 10 seconds so long as you don't move.  Be extremely careful to utilize this effect to avoid dying to <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=285479/flame-jet" target="_blank">Flame Jets</a> and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=282939/flames-of-punishment" target="_blank">Flames of Punishment</a> immediately after a swap.  Phase 1 lasts significantly longer in mythic (5+ mins) and getting everyone through alive will be drastically more difficult.
    <!--## Insert boss specific tips ## -->
    <ul>
    <li>The gold adds live a lot longer in mythic so make sure you save a <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=152108/cataclysm" target="_blank">Cataclysm</a> for the adds as Immolate will most likely fully tick.</li>
