    <!-- ## Basic Boss overview, talent, and trait explanation ## -->
     This is a multi-phased primarily single target encounter with some priority add burns.  Phase 1 is pretty much entirely single target as adds are either Mind Controlled off the boat or obliterated before you can deal any significant damage to them.  Phase 2 has more targets, namely ice blocks and ordinances that must be burned. Phase 3 is 3 separate burst adds (Ice Wall, Nathanos, Tidewater Elemental).  Phase 4 is a single target burn with ranged priority adds (Prismatic Images), and ice blocks. Since there are so many targets that will get ticked at least once above 80% health, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275425/flashpoint" target="_blank">Flashpoint</a> will be very strong for this fight. Outside of Flashpoint, your general single target traits will be best.  As usual your azerite and trinket choices depend on the gear you have available, be sure to sim your character over at <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/topgear" target="_blank">Raidbots</a>.<br>
   
    <!-- ## Insert boss specific tips ## -->
    <ul>
    <li>Unexploded Ordnance barrels can be used to generate shards and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275425/flashpoint" target="_blank">Flashpoint</a> uptime with Immolate, make sure to watch damage on them and stop dots if needed as early breaks can cause wipes.</li>
    <li>Imp can dispel the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=287626/grasp-of-frost" target="_blank">Grasp of Frost</a> and is also the best pet for swapping targets.</li>
    <li>Gateway can be quite useful in p1 to clear fire on far ballistas and in p2 and p3 to reposition around icy patches and get to ordnances and images. </li>

    <!--## Insert Best Legendarie's & why ## -->
    In addition to the drastically increased health and damage of everything in the encounter, the Mythic version of this encounter adds frozen ballistas in phase 1 and has a drastically higher damage requirement for Ice Wall and Jaina in 2nd intermission and in phase 3.  Killing the Tide Elemental in the final phase causes it to split into 2 so the current strategy avoids killing it in favor of interrupting it while bursting the boss down, so you can use it as an extra target to generate shards off of via Havoc and Immolate, and for azerite buffs like Flashpoint and Rolling Havoc.  Incoming damage is extremely high in the latter half of the encounter so <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=219272/demon-skin" target="_blank">Demon Skin</a> is highly recommended and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=288953/treacherous-covenant" target="_blank">Treacherous Covenant</a> is highly not recommended.<br>
    <!--## Insert boss specific tips ## -->
    <ul>
    <li>Havoc can be used on cooldown almost the entire fight due to Frozen Ballistas, Ordnance barrels, and the Tide Elemental.  As a result <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278747/rolling-havoc" target="_blank">Rolling Havoc</a> is extremely strong for all phases.  You will mostly use havoc to cleave off things to generate shards for boss damage rahter than using it to burst other targets, Ice Wall is a mjor exception.</li>
    <li>You will typically use infernal in the last phase rather than the 2nd intermission due to all the movement, and since the phase is so short <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=277644/crashing-chaos" target="_blank">Crashing Chaos</a> is preferred over Flashpoint or other traits.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275425/flashpoint" target="_blank">Flashpoint</a> is a bit of a trap on this encounter as you will only get significant extra uptime in phase 1 due to ballistas and phase 2 due to Ordnance barrels, where damage barely matters overall.  Ice Wall and Tide Elemental will be pushed under 80% too quickly to give significant extra uptime, however it remains one of the stronger traits overall so unless you can replace it with Rolling Havoc or Crashing Chaos you should leave it as is.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=288802/bonded-souls" target="_blank">Bonded Souls</a> provides an insane amount of extra healing and some haste to a friend, consider picking up one of these traits if the healers are struggling.  The shared haste makes this trait perform a lot better in reality than it does in sims.</li>
    <li>Imp can dispel the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=287626/grasp-of-frost" target="_blank">Grasp of Frost</a> and is also the best pet for swapping targets, however the Felhunter can interrupt Jaina as soon as Nathanos is broken in the 2nd intermission if you do not have a Hunter.  The optimal pet play here is starting with Imp for dispels in phase 1 and 2 and swapping to Felhunter in phase 2 prior to the 2nd intermission.</li>
    <li>You will get 3 total Infernals on this fight and 4 total Dark Souls.  In phase 1 you'll use both on pull and 2nd Dark Soul on cooldown afterwards.  You'll have both near the start of phase 2, and both at the start of phase 3 with 2nd pot.  </li>
    <li>Demonic Circle can be used to return to group after mechanics like Avalance and Siegebreaker Blast to alleviate potential freezes.</li>
    <li>Gateway is typically placed across thr room from the Ice Wall towards where Jaina is standing at the start of 2nd intermission to allow the raid to quickly get back to damaging her.  Most guilds will need to hold dps during phase 2 so placing it after the 2nd Blizzard is usually ideal.</li>
